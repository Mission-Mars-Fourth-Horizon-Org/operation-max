# Help Desk Bot Hands-on Lab

## Overview

Throughout these labs you will learn how to create a Help Desk bot. You can choose between C# and Node.js and detailed step-by-step instructions and high-level instructions. You are free to use either sets of instructions to complete the lab.

The goal of the high-level steps is to offer a challenge to developers who like to work through things on their own with minimal guidance. The goal of the step-by-step instructions is to provide prescriptive instructions for developers who are looking for a more structured experience. You may find reading through the high-level steps first, and then using the step-by-step instructions for additional support, can be a successful way to complete the exercises.

You can perform all the exercises in order, or do only try some of them. Each exercise instructs which code to use as starting point, if you did not make the previous exercise. In addition, each exercise contains additional challenges (without provided solutions), offering you the opportunity to enhance your bot and gain more skills.
